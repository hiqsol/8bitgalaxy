	2. Player can reveal rival's hidden cards with [[Explore]] or [[Recon]]
6. Parties can add resources with cards:
	1. At the moment when they add card, not later.
	2. Not more than card's [[Defense]]
7. Defending players can add non-[[Military]] cards. Their combat power is their defense = 1
8. At following rounds parties continue to pass or add more participants and supporters
9. After all parties have passed reveal hidden cards, count total powers and determine winner
10. After action:

## Comments
Ideas behind such implementation:
- there is no random but the result is not predetermined
- players make decisions and take risks
- players can prepare surprises and bluff
