1. Combat starts when player performs [[Attack]] action and can take several rounds
2. At first round:
	- **attacker**:
		- selects **participants**
		- selects **target participants**
		- counts his attack power, it has to be more then [[Defense]] of target
	- **defender**:
		- chooses to admit defeat or add participants to get his defense power higher than attacker power
3. At following rounds parties continue to increase their power or admit defeat
4. After action:
	- Losing direct participants (including target) become [[Damaged]]
	- [[Deplete]] other participants

## Comments
Ideas behind such implementation:
- there is no random but the result is not predetermined
- players make decisions and take risks
- players can prepare surprises
