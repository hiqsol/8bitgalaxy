1. Each **turn** player does in any order:
	1. Two [[Action]]s
	2. One [[AlienSpawn]]
2. Player can't do same action twice in single **turn**
3. More actions can be done with [[PlusAction]] technology
4. Player can pass

#### Notes

1. I can't imagine when pass can be useful. Let me know if you have good example.
