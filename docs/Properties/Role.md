1. **Role** is implicit card [[Property]] derived from [[Type]]
2. Roles:
	1. [[Unit]]
		1. [[Actor]]
	2. [[Structure]]

#### Notes

1. The main conceptual difference between [[Unit]] and [[Structure]] is that
   the former can be drawn and played from hand, while the latter cannot.
2. For example [[Event]] just happens so it can NOT be played from hand, so
   it is not a [[Unit]] but a [[Structure]].
