1. **Transport** is basic action
2. **Transport** action allows to [[Move]] **cargo** with [[Ship]]s
3. **Cargo** can be: cards, reserves
4. Requirements:
     - [[Range]]
     - [[Capacity]]
5. Total [[Capacity]] of the group is sum of capacities of direct participants
6. [[Hero]] can increase [[Capacity]] or [[Range]], but can't transport alone
7. Type limitations in the table below

| Object    | Mil | Cul | Ind | Sci |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base      |     |     |  +  |  +  |
| Colony    |     |  +  |     |  +  |
| Ship      |  +  |     |  +  |  +  |
| Hero      |  +  |  +  |  +  |  +  |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Materials |  +  |  +  |  +  |  +  |
| Wreckage  |  +  |  +  |  +  |  +  |

#### Notes

- e.g. [[Colony]] can only be transported with [[Social]] and [[Scientific]] ships
- Logic behind the table is following:
	- [[Military]] ships can convoy cards that can move on itself
	- [[Culture]] (Colonization) ships can transport social cards
	- [[Industrial]] ships can transport industrial cards
	- [[Scientific]] ships can transport anything
	- [[Hero]]s, [[Materials]] and [[Wreckage]] can be transported with any ships
